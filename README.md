**PLAYERS:** For the normal player, DataShuttle has almost no commands, as all work is done when the player connects to the server. Some servers may allow players to use some of the information commands, listed below.

**ADMINS:** Admins have access to the /datashuttle (Alias /ds) command to fetch DataShuttle info, run some tasks, and edit configuration in-game.
 - /ds info &lt;player&gt; || Returns public account information on sender or optional player.
 - /ds resync &lt;player|all&gt; || Resyncs account data for command sender. Optional player or 'all' param to specify target.
 - /ds config [type] [val] || Edits DataShuttle configuration for your server in-game.
